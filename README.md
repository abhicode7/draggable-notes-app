## 📝 Draggable Notes App 📌

This is a dynamic, interactive web application that allows users to create, drag, and delete sticky notes, providing a fun and efficient way to jot down thoughts and reminders.  It's built using React.js and utilizes local storage to persist notes even after the browser window is closed.

## ✨ Features

- **Create Notes:** Add new notes to your board with a single click. Each note is assigned a unique ID and remembers its position for persistence.
- **Drag and Drop:** Effortlessly move notes around the screen using intuitive drag-and-drop functionality. The app prevents notes from overlapping, ensuring a clean and organized workspace.
- **Edit Notes:** Double-click on a note to activate edit mode, allowing you to modify its content directly. 
- **Delete Notes:** Easily remove notes that are no longer needed with a single click. 
- **Local Storage Persistence:** Your notes are automatically saved to your browser's local storage, so you can pick up where you left off, even after closing the application.
